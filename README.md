# homelab-projects

This project documents my hands-on lab setup where I built and configured a Windows Server 2016 Active Directory Domain Controller and joined a Windows 10 client to the domain â€” all inside Oracle VirtualBox.

## Lab Overview

- Set up a Server 2016 VM and promoted it to a Domain Controller (DC)
- Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Created and joined a Windows 10 VM to the `homelab.local` domain
- Verified domain connectivity via PowerShell and network pinging
- Captured and documented the entire process with screenshots

## Skills Practiced

- Active Directory setup
- Domain Controller promotion
- DNS and network configuration
- Virtual networking (Internal Network in VirtualBox)
- Troubleshooting domain join issues
- GitHub documentation

## Screenshots

Screenshots from each step are included in the repository files.
